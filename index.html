                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><a href="https://etuktukk.github.io/" class="text-primary">eTukTuk</a> is an ambitious project to revolutionize the transportation sector, particularly in developing countries. The heart of this venture lies in implementing an eco-friendly EVSE and introducing an affordable electric TukTuk (eTukTuk). The prime focus of eTukTuk is to combat carbon emissions and their associated health issues. Traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) TukTuks, often used for mass transportation in many countries, are infamous for emitting more CO2 than a standard car. By substituting these vehicles with eTukTuks, the project aims to deliver a cleaner, healthier alternative. eTukTuk uses a decentralized sharing economy model built on Binance’s BNB Chain, ensuring scalability, security, and efficiency. Core values like sustainability, innovation, and economic change drive the platform. eTukTuk’s game-changer lies in its combination of an affordable electric vehicle – the eTukTuk, and a vast network of innovative EVSE charging stations.<br>eTukTuk is a green AI-powered project that has been in presale for some time now, raising over $3.3 million as of the time of writing. The project created electric tuk-tuks powered by both artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.
<br>
<br>
The idea is to offer them in developing countries, and, eventually, enable their distribution on a global scale. However, while this is a big goal for eTukTuk, it is only a way to achieve its true mission.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As mentioned, eTukTuk’s presale has already raised around $3.3 million, selling the TUK token for $0.0315 apiece.<br><br>The project offers the token in exchange for BNB, ETH, and USDT. Alternatively, users can also buy it with their credit or debit cards.<br><br>The TUK token will see its next price increase in about 4 days from now, so there is still time to buy some before its price goes up. 
<br>
<br>Once they buy it, investors can also stake TUK to start earning rewards. This is a great way to secure some passive income, while also contributing to the project that has the potential to help reduce pollution and contribute to saving the world.<br></p>
